PonyShots4Win
=============

This is a very simple Windows client for PonyShots, written in C# with .NET framework 4.5.

At the moment, it simply runs in the background as a tray icon and allows you to press CTRL-SHIFT-2 to take a screenshot of the focused window, or CTRL-SHIFT-4 to take a screenshot of an area that you select. The screenshot is then saved to `C:\Users\<your username>\My Pictures\PonyShots\` and uploaded to PonyShots.

Upon first run, you will be presented with a dialog giving you the path of your configuration file. This must be edited with your PonyShots API URL, image root, username, and API key before use.
